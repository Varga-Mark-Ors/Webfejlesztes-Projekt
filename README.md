# Football wikipedia

I created a football database similar to Wikipedia for my project, where I built two tables, one for players and one for teams and these are connected through contracts.

On the site, users can delete, edit, and create players. They can also browse through pages to learn more about the players and teams.

To run the program, you need to clone the repository. First, navigate to the "Weblap" folder and run the Application.java file. Once it has successfully run, open the "football-wiki" folder in Visual Studio Code and start the app by running npm start. Java must be installed on your device for the project to work.
